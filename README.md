# Courses homework

Hi! I'm a programming and data science enthusiast, and I like to learn more about it whenever I have some quality time. Recently I've started looking into some courses that I find interesting, and I've decided to create a GitHub repository just to keep all the homework centralized and easily available from any device.

If you stumbled upon this repository you probably won't find it useful or interesting, but if by any chance you want to find some interesting courses, feel free to peek below. With the little quality time I'm able to find for taking these courses, you can bet that any course I've decided to finish has my seal of approval.

## Some cool things I learned!
